title: About me
---
Currently, I am in Purdue University. 

I graduated from *Yonsei University*, studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering.  
In 2022, I worked as a research assistant in the Statistical Artificial Intelligence Lab in Kaist Graduate School of AI. In this lab, I worked on Energy-based model and Integrated Gradients. My research project was focused on analyzing an Energy-based model for generating images.
After taking Communication Network Lecture, I got interested in Sensing Systems. Therefore, I applied as a research assistant in the Cyper-Physical Systems and Security(CyPhy) Lab. In the Cyphy Lab, we researched a novel system to identify Chewing Side preference using earables. 
In my senior year, my friends and I started a business, AboutBooks, a book-renting system for children based on their preferences. For our business, I developed an Artificial Intelligence model that recommends books depending on children’s interests using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a model that analyzes children’s reading status using book evaluation. 
In 2020, I participated in the Study Abroad Program and took lectures in University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After that, I worked as a research assistant in the Image and Video Pattern Recognition (MVP) Lab in Yonsei University, studying Image Processing Techniques and Deep learning for Computer Vision. In the MVP Lab, I wrote my thesis, Masked Face Recognition. 
I am passionate about the field of AI and its potential to transform various industries and aspects of our lives, and I am excited to contribute to this field through my research.
